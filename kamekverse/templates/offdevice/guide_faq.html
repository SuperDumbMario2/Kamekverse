                    <p>If you encounter a post or comment that violates the {{name}} Code of Conduct, please report the violation using the {{name}} reporting function.</p>
                    <p>Reported violations will be reviewed by a Nintendo moderator.  Any post that violates the {{name}} Code of Conduct will be removed.</p>

                    <p>It’s up to users to mark their posts as having spoilers. However, if someone forgets to do this, you can help by reporting spoilers.</p>
